        <h2>Which communities were involved in the signing of Treaty 1?</h2>
        <p>
          These communities were involved in forming Treaty One: the
          Anishinaabe, Muskegon Cree peoples, and the Crown.

        <h2>About the communities</h2>
        <p>
          The Anishinaabe originated on the northeast coast of what is now
          Canada and the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Muskegon were native-born Americans from
          <span style="color: rgb(140, 24, 24)">New England</span>, New York,
          and Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p>The Crown refers to the royals from England.</p>

        <h2>What were the terms of the Treaty 1 agreement?</h2>
        <p>
          In Treaty One, the band of Yellow Quill would receive a further 25
          square miles of land to be laid out around the reserve.
        </p>
        <p>The Indigenous peoples were granted 160 acres of land per family.</p>

        <h2>What makes Treaty 1 different from other treaties?</h2>
        <p>
          In the final agreement of Treaty 1, Indigenous peoples were to hand
          over most of their land in southeast and south-central Manitoba to
          Governor Archibald and the Crown.

        <h2>How is the treaty being implemented today?</h2>
        <p>
          An example of Treaty 1's current implementation is the Kapyong urban
          reserve, created after a longstanding negotiation between the
          government and First Nations.
