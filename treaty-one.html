        <h2>Which communities were involved in the signing of Treaty 1?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          These communities were involved in forming Treaty One: the
          Anishinaabe, Muskegon Cree peoples, and the Crown.

        <h2>About the communities</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The Anishinaabe originated on the northeast coast of what is now
          Canada and the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Muskegon were native-born
          <span style="color: blue">Americans</span> from
          <span style="color: rgb(140, 24, 24)">New England</span>, New York,
          and Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Crown refers to the
          <span style="color: rgb(227, 195, 8)">royals</span> from England.

          <span style="color: yellow">Yellow</span>Quill would receive a further
          25 square miles of land to be laid out around the reserve.

        <h2>What makes Treaty 1 different from other treaties?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In the final agreement of Treaty 1, Indigenous peoples were to hand
          over most of their land in southeast and south-central Manitoba to
          Governor Archibald and the Crown.

        <h2>How is the treaty being implemented today?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          An example of Treaty 1's current implementation is the Kapyong urban
          reserve, created after a longstanding negotiation between the
          government and First Nations.
