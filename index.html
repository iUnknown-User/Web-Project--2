      <h2>Which communities were involved in the signing of tready 1?</h2>
      <p>
        These were the communities that were involved in forming Treaty One: the
        Anishinaabe, Muskegon Cree peoples, and the Crown.
      </p>
      <strong>https://www.canada.ca/</strong>
      <h2>About the communities</h2>
      <p>
        The Anishinaabe originated on the northeast coast of what is now Canada
        and the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Muskegon were native-born
        <span style="color: blue">Americans </span>from
        <span style="color: rgb(140, 24, 24)">New England</span>, New York, and
        Pennsylvania.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crown refers to the <span style="color: gold">royals</span> from
        England.

      <h2>What were the terms to the aggreement to tready 1?</h2>
      <p>
        The terms discussed in the agreement of Treaty One said that "In Treaty
        One, the band of Yellow Quill will resive a further 25 square miles of
        land to be laid out around the reserve."
      </p>
      <p>The indiginous peoples were given 160 acres of land per family</p>
      <p>
        Also in the agreement, the Indigenous peoples were to hand over a large
        portion of land in the southeast and south-central current-day Manitoba
        to Governor Archibald and the Crown.

      <h2>How is the tready being implemented today?</h2>
      <p>
        This treaty is being implemented today with the example of the Kapyong
        urban reserve, which was given to them after a long-standing fight
        between the government and the First Nations.
