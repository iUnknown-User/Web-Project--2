      <h2>Which communities were involved in the signing of Treaty 1?</h2>
      <p>
        These communities were involved in forming Treaty One: the Anishinaabe,
        Muskegon Cree peoples, and the Crown.
      </p>

      <h2>About the communities</h2>
      <p>
        The Anishinaabe originated on the northeast coast of what is now Canada
        and the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Muskegon were native-born
        <span style="color: blue">Americans</span> from
        <span style="color: rgb(140, 24, 24)">New England</span>, New York, and
        Pennsylvania.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crown refers to the <span style="color: gold">royals</span> from
        England.

      <h2>What were the terms of the Treaty 1 agreement?</h2>
      <p>
        In Treaty One, the band of Yellow Quill would receive a further 25
        square miles of land to be laid out around the reserve.
      </p>
      <p>The Indigenous peoples were granted 160 acres of land per family.</p>

      <h2>What makes Treaty 1 different from other treaties?</h2>
      <p>
        In the final agreement of Treaty 1, Indigenous peoples were to hand over
        most of their land in southeast and south-central Manitoba to Governor
        Archibald and the Crown.

      <h2>How is the treaty being implemented today?</h2>
      <p>
        An example of Treaty 1's current implementation is the Kapyong urban
        reserve, created after a longstanding negotiation between the government
        and First Nations.
